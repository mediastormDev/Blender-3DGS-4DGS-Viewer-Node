# Blender Gaussian Quick Viewer (3DGS / 4DGS)
![Banner Recommendation](asset/Banner_Corgi.png)

Overview

A custom Blender node originally developed by Mediastorm during the ASUS 4DGS Yungang Grottoes project.
It supports loading and previewing of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) and 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) datasets,

providing basic visualization styles for quick inspection and camera motion design.
This viewer represents an early component of the Universal Gaussian Rendering System (UGRS),
a broader R&D effort exploring unified Gaussian rendering and visualization workflows.

Its technology was later featured in the SIGGRAPH 2025 Real-Time Live! showcase
“InfiniteStudio: 4D Volumetric Capture for Filmmaking and Beyond” —
which received the Best in Show Award.

The Blender demo from that showcase has since been officially included in the Blender Demo Files collection:

## How to Use
1. Clone or download this repository.

2. Add the provided assets into your Blender scene collection.（The sample project already includes a 4D corgi .ply asset.）

3. Create a new collection to store seq05 and exclude it from rendering visibility.

4. If using a new project:
   Go to File → Append → NodeTree → GeometryNodesTree
   Add the node group in the Geometry Nodes editor via Add (Shift + A) → Group → GeometryNodesTree

5. Load the 3DGS/4DGS .ply file through the node’s file path input, and ensure the parameters match the reference setup.

6. Control playback via the Frame_Index_input parameter. You can keyframe it manually or enter #frame to bind it to the current timeline frame.

⚠️ Important:
If your 4DGS .ply file contains an attribute named t, rename it to ttt before import —
Blender silently ignores attributes named t due to internal parsing rules.

Special thanks to Zhang Yu (4DV.ai)
for clarifying the fundamental differences between 3DGS and 4DGS in the early stages of development.
His guidance ensured this tool was built on a correct conceptual foundation.
